I know, cheesy title for the very first post of this blog, but as a developer, I wouldn't want it any other way.

## Why

I'm creating this blog to share my knowledge, not that's much, but if you learn something here, that's enough for me :)

My goal is to create a post in situations where I learn something in which I find it to be very useful or even to share any curious situation that I might encounter myself with.

This blog is a bit inspired by my friend's blog, [Pawel](https://pawelgrzybek.com/). His blog is pretty neat and he frequently posts interesting stuff.

In the future, I want to look at this blog and think of it as a small repository of my knowledge, and maybe even relearning something that got forgotten.

## What comes next

Hopefully in the next few days, I'll be doing a blog post showing all the things I've learned while setting up this blog.

If you want to know more about me, check my [about](/about) page.

See you soon, and remember, always write tests!

```javascript
expect(myBlog.posts[0].title).to.equal("Hello world!");
```

```bash
> mocha

My personal blog
  âœ“ should have one welcoming post
```
