Born in 1995 in a small city in the north of Portugal, Viana do Castelo.

In 2017 I moved to Porto to start working at [Mindera](https://mindera.com) as a backend developer.

I'm currently focused on building backend services running on top of NodeJS in serverless architectures.

As hobbies, I usually go to the gym everyday, it keeps my body healthy and mostly, it clears my mind. I'm also a tv shows fan and spend (or invest? :)) some time reading techy posts or watching techy videos.

Back when I was younger, I used to be a bmx rider, which is so far, what left me the best memories and I feel the most proud of.
